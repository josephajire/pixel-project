Hello!

This is my submission for the Pixel Art Maker Project for the Google Africa Challenge Scholarship.

The project could be accessed from https://josephajire.github.io/pixel-project/ 

This project is a web application that avails the users the opportunity to come up with a canvas on which their desired pixel art could be made.

How to use the web app:<br>
--Specify the height and width of the canvas by inputting your  desired values. <br>
--Click 'Submit Query'<br>
After clicking 'Submit Query', your canvas will be displayed.

To paint the canvas as you wish, click the color box under 'Pick A Color'. From the color dialog box that will thereafter be displayed, click on your desired color and then click Ok.
You can then click the boxes within the canvas you created to paint it to form the pixel art of your choice.

Thank you and have fun.
